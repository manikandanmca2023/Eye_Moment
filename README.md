# Eye_Moment

Create an HTML file with a basic structure. You'll need an element that represents the eye, usually a div or an image element.
Style the eye element to make it look like an eye. You can use CSS to set the eye's appearance, including the eye shape, color, and border.
Write JavaScript code to track the mouse cursor's position and update the eye's position accordingly. Here are the key steps:
When the mouse moves, capture its X and Y coordinates.
Calculate the new position for the eye element based on the mouse coordinates. You can achieve this by adjusting the eye's CSS top and left properties.
To create a realistic eye movement effect, you can also limit the eye's movement within a certain range so that it doesn't follow the mouse cursor exactly.
You can add animation effects to make the eye movement smoother and more lifelike. This might involve easing functions or transitions to make the eye follow the mouse cursor with a delay, creating a more natural effect.
